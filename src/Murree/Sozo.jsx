   <p className='col-7'>Murree is one of the largest resort towns in the Galyat region of Pakistan, and is the municipal capital of Murree Tehsil, an administrative division of the Rawalpindi District. As well as being tehsil headquarters, Murree is also a Union Council, bounded to the north by Darya Gali and Rawat, to the west by Ghora Gali and Tret, to the south by Numbal and Mussiari, and to the east by Ghel and Angoori. Formerly comprising the same administrative unit, in 1850 the British decided to divide the regions between the Rawalpindi and Hazara provinces. However, the two regions are inseparable geographically, culturally, and linguistically.</p>
