   <p className='col-7'>Iqbal Academy Pakistan was originally established in 1951, under the administrative authority of the education department of the central government of Pakistan, in Karachi. When the capital of Pakistan was moved to Islamabad, the government decided to move Iqbal Academy from Karachi to Lahore, as Muhammad Iqbal, for whom the academy is named, was from Lahore. In 1976, the Academy moved to 116 McLeod Road, Lahore, to the old residence of Allama Iqbal. The federal government of Pakistan made a gift of a piece of land from a major estate in Lahore, behind one of the Avari Hotels and opposite Faletti's Hotel, to build a state-of-the-art building named Aiwan-e-Iqbal, as a monument and memorial to Iqbal. In 1996, the new building was formally opened by Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, and the Academy moved to the sixth floor</p>
