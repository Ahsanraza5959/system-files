   <p className='col-7'>Churches from the British era can still be found in Murree and Nathia Gali. There is an Anglican church, built in 1857, located at the centre of the town, which is still used as a place of worship. Many houses around the church are still standing, functioning mostly as hotels. Old traditional restaurants have been replaced by fast-food shops and newer restaurants.

The Murree residence of the Punjab Governor is the Kashmir Point, an imposing building built in the 19th century by the British. There are Punjab and Sindh houses to cater needs of the provincial government. Similarly, there are rest houses for the judges of the Supreme Court and Lahore High Court. A large number of government, semi-government and private departments and institutions maintain guesthouses in Murree. A number of diplomatic missions based in Islamabad established their camp offices in Murree in the 1960s, although they are now seldom used. </p>
