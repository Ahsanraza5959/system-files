   <p className='col-7'>The Karachi War Cemetery was created to receive World War II dead from cemeteries scattered across the country, as it was felt that their proper maintenance could not be assured.[1]

In 2016, British Deputy High Commissioner Ms Belinda Lewis, Defence Adviser Brigadier Murray Whiteside and British Naval and Air Adviser Group Captain John Alexander attended the Remembrance Service at the Karachi War Cemetery.
All the graves (642) are from World War II. There are numerous recipients of Mention in Dispatches (MiD) and Distinguished Service Order (DSO), three recipients of the coveted Military Cross (MC), as well as one listed with Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) and three with the Order of the British Empire (OBE) </p>
