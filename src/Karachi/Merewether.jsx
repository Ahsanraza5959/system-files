   <p className='col-7'>Merewether Tower was raised by public subscription as a memorial for Sir William L. Merewether, who served as Commissioner of Sindh from 1867 to 1877. Designed by James Strachan, the Municipal Engineer of Karachi, the foundation stone was laid by the Governor of Bombay, Sir James Fergusson in 1884.
   Strachan designed the tower in the Gothic Revival style popular in Victorian England, to evoke the architecture of Medieval England (11th to 15th century CE). The architecture takes the form of an Eleanor cross.

The clocktower stands on a base of 44 feet square and rises to a height of 102 feet.[2] 4 clocks are situated at a height of 70 feet on each facade, with a bell that weighs 300 pounds that strikes on the hour.[10] Smaller bells weighing 100 pounds strike on the quarter-hour.[10]</p>
