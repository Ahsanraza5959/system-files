   <p className='col-6'>Ghanta Ghar or Clock Tower of Multan was built in 1884 A.D. during British Raj in South Asia. After passing municipal act 1883 British needed offices to run the city. They started constructing Ghanta Ghar in Multan on 12 February 1884 and it took 4 years to completely build this building.  It was constructed over the ruins of Haveli of Ahmad Khan Sadozai which was completely destroyed during Siege of Multan. The hall and building was named 'Ripon Hall and Ripon Building' after the name of Ripon, viceroy of India at that time. And clock tower was named Northbrook Tower after the name of Northbrook, a former viceroy of India (1872-1876).This building was completed, opened and offices shifted in 1888.

Hall was named 'Jinnah Hall' after the independence of Pakistan in 1947 and it used for office meetings, cultural programs and public was also allowed to enter here. With passage of time this building became insufficient for offices and small hall was also insufficient for meetings, so offices were shifted from here. Now idea is to change this historic building into a museum. </p>
