   <p className='col-7'>Frere Hall is a building in Karachi, Pakistan that dates from the early British colonial-era in Sindh. Completed in 1865, Frere Hall was originally intended to serve as Karachi's town hall,[1] and now serves as an exhibition space and library.
   The building was intended to serve as Karachi's town hall, and was designed by Henry Saint Clair Wilkins,[1] after having been chosen from among 12 possible choices.[3]

The building's land was purchased at a cost of 2,000 British Indian rupees, which had been donated by WP Andrew of the Scinde Railway, and Sir Frederick Arthur Bartholomew.[1] The total cost of the Hall was about 180,000 rupees, out of which the Government contributed 10,000 rupees, while the rest was paid for by Karachi municipality.[4]

Work commenced in August 1863, and completed in October 1865,[5] though work on the building had not been entirely completed by the time of its inauguration.[3] </p>
