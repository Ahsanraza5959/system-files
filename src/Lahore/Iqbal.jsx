   <p className='col-7'>Iqbal was one of the major inspirations behind the Pakistan Movement, and is revered in Pakistan as Muffakir-e-Pakistan (The Thinker of Pakistan) or Shair-e-Mashriq (The Poet of the East).[1] Iqbal died on 21 April 1938 in Lahore at the age of 60. Thousands of visitors come to the mausoleum every day to pay their respects to the poet-philosopher.[2] It is said that Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk sent earth collected from Maulana Rumi's tomb to be sprinkled on this grave
   Soon after Iqbal's death in April 1938, a committee was formed that was presided over by Chaudhary Mohammed Hussain.[4]

A major problem in the realisation of this monument was a lack adequate funds. The committee resolved not to accept any donations from the local governments and state rulers, and so funds were raised through the contributions from Iqbal's friends, admirers and disciples</p>
