   <p className='col-7'> An English resident allotted 7Faseel e Multan is an ancient wall encircling the old city of Multan. It was built and rebuilt many times as it was destroyed in battles. The original construction time is unknown but it was present during the Siege of Multan and damaged badly. Part of this wall near Haram Gate was totally destroyed and was used by British troops to enter into the city. The present wall was constructed in 1756 AD.63 acres for this purpose. It is located in Multan cantonment under the control of Pak army. It is also known as Service Club, Multan. This amazing master piece contains 13 domes of different size. Those domes were made up by mud (GACHEE MITI) of Chenab River.

Â­This is also a truth that except few buildings of Turkey, all walls consist of 9 & 11 domes. There is no other building having so many numbers of domes of different sizes but geometrically same. </p>
