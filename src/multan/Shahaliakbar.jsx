   <p className='col-7'>Shah Ali Akbar was a great-great-grandson of Shah Shams Sabzwari, an early proselytizer of Isma'ili Islam in South Asia active in the mid-to-late 13th century. A foundation stone on the tomb provides its date of construction as 1585, indicating that Ali Akbar's ministry flourished in the mid-16th century. Oral traditions among his descendants strongly suggest the tomb was financed by Ali Akbar himself, indicating a degree of personal wealth that could only have been attained in an atmosphere of good relations with local authorities, implying official sanction (or at minimum, tolerance) of Ismai'li activities in this period.

The tomb greatly resembles the nearby mausoleum of Rukn-e Alam, so much so that it is often informally referred to as the "little Rukn-e Alam". Both monuments employ battered walls, tapering turrets, and an octagonal groundplan capped with domes. Brickwork predominates in both buildings with wood used as structural framework and for certain specific purposes such as lintels. All of these features are typical of the so-called Tughluq style which briefly flourished with the fortunes of the dynasty. However, even though the Tughluqs were long out of power by the time Ali Akbar embarked upon his career, the building style they pioneered continued to flourish in Multan and in neighboring areas, particularly Uch Sharif.</p>
